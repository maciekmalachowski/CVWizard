        Extract key skills, spoken languages, and a summary from the given CV.

        1. For each job listed in the CV, extract the relevant skills mentioned in the job title, description, and responsibilities.
        2. For each project listed in the CV, identify the skills and technologies used, including any specific tools, languages, or methods mentioned.
        3. List all spoken languages explicitly mentioned in the CV, whether in the personal details, education, or language sections.
        4. Generate a brief summary of the candidate's experience, highlighting key industries, expertise areas, years of experience, and any notable achievements. The summary should be a well-structured text paragraph.
        5. Return the output **strictly** as a valid JSON object with the following structure:

        {
            "summary": "John Doe is a software engineer with 5 years of experience in the finance and healthcare industries. He specializes in machine learning, full-stack development, and cloud computing. Notable achievements include developing an AI-powered chatbot that reduced customer support response time by 40% and leading a team of 5 engineers to build a scalable data pipeline for financial analytics.",
            "skills": ["Python", "HTML", "Numpy", "Pandas", "Docker", "Java", "Jupyter Notebook", "LLMs", "Langchain", "LlamaIndex", "AutoML", "Scikit-learn", "Hugging Face"],
            "languages": ["English", "Spanish"]
        }

        Ensure the AI carefully considers each job and project and accurately identifies skills and languages. The summary should be **concise yet informative**, capturing the candidateâ€™s key strengths and accomplishments in natural language. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting outside of this JSON structure.
